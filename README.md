# pyCEC ‚Äì Python HDMI-CEC bridge for Kodi and Home Assistant

**pyCEC** is a lightweight Python bridge for controlling HDMI devices over the [CEC (Consumer Electronics Control)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Control) protocol. It is designed to act as a glue between media software like **Kodi** and smart home systems like **Home Assistant**. But it can serve as a python binding to the C++ [**libcec**](https://libcec.pulse-eight.com/) library too.

Additionally, it provides a TCP server that proxies CEC commands from the network to the local CEC adapter and the Kodi plugin that acts the same way, but uses Kodi's CEC API instead of direct calls to the libcec.

To send commands over a network you can use bundled commandline client, [netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat) or configure the pyCEC library in your code to connect to the _pyCEC_ server instead of the local CEC adapter.
